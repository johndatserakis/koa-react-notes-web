# Koa-React-Notes-Web

This is a simple SPA built using [Koa](http://koajs.com/) (2.5.1) as the backend and [React](https://reactjs.org/) (16.4.1) as the frontend. Click [here](https://github.com/johndatserakis/koa-vue-notes-api) to see the backend Koa code. Click [here](https://koa-vue-notes-web.innermonkdesign.com/) to view the app live. You can also check out the [koa-vue-notes-project](https://github.com/johndatserakis/koa-vue-notes-project) repo if you like to have both your frontend and backend living within the same folder.

### General Information

For information on this project you can check out [koa-vue-notes-api](https://github.com/johndatserakis/koa-vue-notes-api) or [koa-vue-notes-web](https://github.com/johndatserakis/koa-vue-notes-web). The projects general concept is to create a simple notes in using modern technologies. Initially, Koa-Vue-Notes was an app that used Koa on the backend and Vue on the frontend.

This project changes that up a bit - and is the same `koa-vue-notes-web` app, but written in React. This is perfect for someone who wants to take a good look at both frameworks a little bit more in depth than the usually tutoral blog posts.

### Notes

Note the `.env` file in the root of the project - that is there to provide an alias to the root folder - so when you're importing you own components you don't have to fuss with the path.
